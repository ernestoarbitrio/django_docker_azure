# Deploy a Django application connected to Azure SQL using Docker and Azure App Service

This is the repository to share the code I used to write a post on my blog.
In the post I would like to share my experience during the deployment phase of a Django App connected to SQL Azure database. This was the first time I used Azure to deploy my applications and I'd no idea which approach to use. I had 2 way:

VM with specified size and O.S. (IaaS)
Azure App Service (SaaS)
Well, considering that I didn't want manage the server as whole, I decided for the second one.

Azure Web Apps enables you to build and host web applications in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure; you can choose several application types according to your needs and technology.

What I used is Web App on Linux (App Service by Microsoft) and Docker. Here a step-by-step guide try.
